# KPOP Next Big Sound

#### Description: A web application utilizing the Python-based web framework Flask, that tracks and ranks social metrics and statistics of KPOP artists. The data used in this were personally compiled by me since year 2020 and 2021 by web-scraping and utilizing API from nextbigsound.com and guyso.me. This web application is essentially helpful for people in the KPOP community to help them keep track of their idol's engagement and performance in the different social platforms. This web app utilizes Bootstrap 4.5.3, PostgreSQL as database and JavaScript with JQuery. It has built-in support feature for logging in/out and signing up as well as changing passwords.
